<p>This map explores walking distance acess to public transit in Meck County NC. Vector files of the county as well as the track layouts of the various LYNX light rail lines were downloaded, using the Buffer tool (as a batch process) a one mile buffer around the tracks was placed. Then the union tool was used to find the total area that was within a mile of a light rail track. From there the symetrical difference tool was used to give us a vector of the area outside of walking distance. This vector was then overlayed on ac= raster of Meck County. The various LYNX lines are shown as well to show which areas had acess to multiple lines.  </p>
